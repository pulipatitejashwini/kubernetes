# Kubernetes Hands-On Project (Minikube)

## About the Project
This project demonstrates basic to intermediate Kubernetes concepts using Minikube.                     

It includes:                 
- Setting up a Kubernetes cluster                                              
- Creating a Pod using YAML                  
- Creating a Deployment                    
- Scaling the application                 
- Performing Rolling Updates                                           
- Performing Rollback                   
- Configuring Liveness and Readiness Probes                     

The application used in this project is Nginx.                      

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to:                    
- Understand how Kubernetes manages containers                          
- Learn how to deploy applications using YAML                      
- Practice scaling applications                    
- Understand rolling updates and rollback                        
- Implement health checks using probes                      

This project simulates a simple production-style deployment.
